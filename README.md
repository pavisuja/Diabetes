# Diabetes Prediction Flask Web App

![diabetes](https://github.com/pavisuja/Diabetes)


This repository contains the code for a web-based diabetes prediction application using a machine learning model. The application is built using Flask and allows users to input various health parameters to predict the likelihood of diabetes.
## Overview

The web app utilizes a machine learning model, specifically an ensemble model combining RandomForestClassifier, LogisticRegression, and Support Vector Machine (SVM), to provide predictions. The model was trained on the diabetes dataset from kaggle.

## Features

- Users can input their health parameters such as Glucose level, Blood Pressure, Skin Thickness, Insulin level, BMI, Diabetes Pedigree Function (DPF), and Age.
- The ensemble machine learning model predicts the likelihood of diabetes based on the input.
- The app displays the prediction result, indicating whether the user is likely to have diabetes or not.
- Users can receive accurate and quick predictions for early diabetes detection.

## Model

The machine learning model used in this app is an ensemble of RandomForestClassifier, LogisticRegression, and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The ensemble approach combines the strengths of these classifiers to improve prediction accuracy.

Problem Statement (Diabetes):

## Problem Statement
Diabetes is a serious and growing global health concern, affecting millions of individuals worldwide. The traditional diagnosis methods involve costly, time-consuming, and often invasive procedures. This web application aims to provide a simple, data-driven tool that predicts the likelihood of a person having diabetes based on several health metrics, including glucose levels, BMI, insulin levels, and age.

Demo Web App Details
For the demo of the web app, you can showcase how users interact with the model:
1.	Input: Users enter health data such as glucose levels, BMI, age, insulin levels, etc.
2.	Prediction: The machine learning model processes the inputs and predicts whether the user is at risk for diabetes.
3.	User Interface: Simple and intuitive UI built using Streamlit.
Project Overview
The Diabetes Prediction Web App is designed to predict the risk of diabetes using machine learning models. It provides users with an easy-to-use interface to input their health parameters and receive an instant prediction

Project Introduction (My View)
In my view, this project leverages machine learning to address a significant healthcare problem: the early detection of diabetes.
